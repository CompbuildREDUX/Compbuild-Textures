## Compbuild Textures Realism

Compbuild Textures is a resource pack with over 1000+ unique custom vanilla models. We have one-of-a-kind features that no other resource packs have such as biome-dependent models, textures, and more! Compbuild specializes in realism and creating the most realistic environments within Minecraft. What makes the pack special is that we have furniture, flora, and a large variety of blocks to choose from.

#### Free

Compbuild Textures is, always, completely free and available. There is no paid support, no paid updates, no trial/full version, nothing. You are only being charged if you'd like early access to new releases. 

#### Why?

There are a lot of high quality packs that have similar content, but most of them are locked behind an expensive paywall or they're extremely deceiving. Everything that you see our pack can do - you can do it.
